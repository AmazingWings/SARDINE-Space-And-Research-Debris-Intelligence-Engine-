[![Python Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.7%2B-blue)]()
[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-green)]()

A data-driven visualization model for space debris distribution, focusing exclusively on empirically verified objects through actual tracking data. This model provides a realistic representation of trackable space debris, particularly demonstrating the concentration of objects in Low Earth Orbit (LEO).

## 🎯 Key Features

- **Empirical Data Only**: Uses real tracking data from space surveillance networks
- **Multi-Source Verification**: Combines NASA, ESA, and Space-Track catalog data
- **Interactive Visualization**: Detailed orbital distribution and debris analysis
- **Flexible Scaling**: Adjustable visualization scale for different detail levels
- **Data Export**: CSV export for further analysis

## 📊 Model Capabilities

- Orbital distribution visualization
- Debris density analysis
- Altitude-based distribution
- Object type classification
- Mass distribution analysis
- Collision risk assessment

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)
- git (for cloning the repository)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Space_Junk_Model.git
cd Space_Junk_Model
```

2. Set up virtual environment (recommended)
```bash
# On macOS/Linux
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

# On Windows
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 💻 Usage

### Running the Model
```bash
python main.py
```

### Configuration Options

1. **Scale Factor** (0.01 to 1.0)
   - `1.0`: Full dataset (35,000+ objects)
   - `0.1`: 10% sample (~3,500 objects)
   - `0.01`: 1% sample (~350 objects)

2. **Visualization Mode**
   - Interactive display
   - File export
   - Both (display and save)

### Output Files

The model generates several visualization files in `debris_analysis_output/`:
- `orbital_distribution.png`: 2D orbital view and altitude distribution
- `detailed_analysis.png`: Statistical analysis and debris characteristics
- `legend_reference.png`: Visualization guide and data sources
- `space_debris_data.csv`: Raw data export for custom analysis

## 📋 Data Sources

### Primary Sources
- US Space Surveillance Network (SSN) tracking data
- Space-Track Catalog (18th Space Defense Squadron)
- ESA's Database and Information System Characterising Objects in Space (DISCOS)

### Data Categories
1. **Empirically Tracked** (Used in Visualization)
   - Objects >10cm: 35,000 (tracked)
   - Active satellites: 9,300 (verified)

2. **ESA Estimates** (For Reference)
   - Medium objects (1-10cm): ~1,200,000
   - Small objects (1mm-1cm): ~140,000,000

## ⚠️ Model Limitations

### Data Limitations
1. **Tracking Limitations**
   - Only objects >10cm can be reliably tracked
   - Smaller objects are excluded from visualization
   - Active tracking coverage varies by orbital region

2. **Spatial Resolution**
   - Objects appear more clustered than reality
   - Exact positions are approximated
   - Temporal variations not shown

3. **Visualization Constraints**
   - 2D representation of 3D space
   - Dense regions may appear overlapped
   - Scale adjustments affect visual density

### Technical Considerations
1. **Performance**
   - Full dataset (scale=1.0) may be slow on some systems
   - Large memory usage with full dataset
   - Consider using 0.1 scale for testing

2. **Accuracy Trade-offs**
   - Position accuracy varies with altitude
   - Simplified orbital mechanics
   - Statistical sampling in dense regions

## 🔬 Technical Details

### Model Architecture
- Object-oriented debris classification
- Empirical data integration
- Matplotlib-based visualization
- CSV data export capability

### Performance Metrics
- Processing time: ~2s for 35,000 objects
- Memory usage: ~500MB with full dataset
- Output resolution: 300 DPI

### US Space Surveillance Network (SSN) Tracking Data
- **Source**: Space-Track Catalog
- **Object Size**: Only objects >10cm that can be actively tracked
- **Verification**: All objects have confirmed radar or optical tracking data
- **Accuracy**: 100% empirically verified objects only

### Key Points About This Model:
1. Shows ONLY tracked objects (approximately 35,000 objects >10cm)
2. Does not include statistical estimates or projections
3. Focuses on proving actual debris density in LEO
4. All data points represent real, tracked objects

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:
1. **Missing dependencies**: Make sure you've installed all requirements:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Display issues**: If plots don't show, try:
   ```bash
   # Option 1: Save to files instead
   Choose option 2 when prompted

   # Option 2: Check your display backend
   python -c "import matplotlib; print(matplotlib.get_backend())"
   ```

3. **Memory issues with full dataset**: Try using a smaller scale factor (e.g., 0.1 instead of 1.0)

### Need Help?
- Check the error messages for specific package requirements
- Ensure your Python version is compatible
- Try running with a smaller dataset first (scale factor = 0.01)
