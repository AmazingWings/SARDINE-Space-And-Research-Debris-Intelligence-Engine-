# SARDINE-Space-And-Research-Debris-Intelligence-Engine
A data-driven visualization model for space debris distribution, focusing exclusively on empirically verified objects through actual tracking data. This model provides a realistic representation of trackable space debris, particularly demonstrating the concentration of objects in Low Earth Orbit (LEO).
